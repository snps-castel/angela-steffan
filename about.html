            <h1>About Your Therapist</h1>
            <p>Hello, and welcome. I'm so glad you're here. My journey into therapy began with my own path of healing and a deep belief that everyone deserves to feel whole, understood, and at peace with themselves.</p>
            
            <p>For over a decade, I've had the privilege of walking alongside individuals through their most challenging moments and their greatest breakthroughs. My approach is rooted in warmth, curiosity, and the understanding that healing happens in relationship—with ourselves, with nature, and with each other.</p>
            
            <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
            <p>I believe that you are the expert on your own life. My role is not to fix you—because you're not broken—but to provide a compassionate, non-judgmental space where you can explore, grow, and rediscover your innate capacity for healing.</p>
            
            <p>Nature has always been my greatest teacher. The cycles of seasons, the resilience of trees, the patience of rivers—these natural rhythms remind us that healing is not linear. It unfolds in its own time, with gentleness and grace.</p>

            <h2>Beyond the Office</h2>
            <p>When I'm not in session, you'll find me hiking forest trails, tending to my garden, practicing yoga, or curled up with a good book and herbal tea. I believe in practicing what I share—staying connected to nature, moving my body, and honoring rest as a sacred practice.</p>
